Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, 
runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same,
regardless of the environment it is running in.
